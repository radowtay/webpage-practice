<p>I'm a runaway musician that secretly harbored a love of mathematics, science, and nature.  
    I still adore the work I have done previously, but I am very excited for this new adventure.</p>
<p>Although I loved teaching, it is not compatible with the sort of lifestyle someone with a 
    chronic pain illness must live.  Here's to a lifestyle with a job that brings passion AND balance to your life!</p>
