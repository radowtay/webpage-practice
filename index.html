<p>I'm a runaway musician that secretly harbored a love of mathematics, science, and nature.  
    I still adore the work I have done previously, but I am very excited for this new adventure.</p>
<p>Although I loved teaching, I have had a chronic pain illness since the age of 13, and it ended up not being possible to continue with the demands of the job.  Here's to a lifestyle with a job that brings passion AND balance to your life!</p>
